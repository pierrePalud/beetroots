Beetroots (BayEsian infErence with spaTial Regularization of nOisy multi-line ObservaTion mapS) is a Python package that performs Bayesian inference of physical parameters from multispectral-structured cubes with a dedicated sampling algorithm.
Thanks to this sampling algorithm, `beetroots` provides maps of credibility intervals along with estimated maps.

The sampling algorithm is introduced in

   P. Palud, P.-A. Thouvenin, P. Chainais, E. Bron, and F. Le Petit - **Efficient sampling of non log-concave posterior distributions with mixture of noises**, *IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing*, vol. 71, pp. 2491 -- 2501, 2023. DOI: `10.1109/TSP.2023.3289728 <https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2023.3289728>`_


Such inversions rely on a forward model that is assumed to emulate accurately the physics of the observed environment.
In parallel of the inversion, `beetroots` tests this hypothesis to evaluate the validity of the inference results.
The testing method is described in (in French)

   P. Palud, P. Chainais, F. Le Petit, P.-A. Thouvenin and E. Bron - **Problèmes inverses et test bayésien d'adéquation du modèle**, *GRETSI - Groupe de Recherche en Traitement du Signal et des Images* in *29e Colloque sur le traitement du signal et des images*, Grenoble, pp. 705 -- 708, 2023.

This package was applied e.g., to infer physical conditions in different regions of the interstellar medium in

   P. Palud, P.-A. Thouvenin, P. Chainais, E. Bron, F. Le Petit and ORION-B consortium - **Beetroots: Bayesian inference of interstellar medium physical parameter maps with a spatial regularization -- Application to Orion**, submitted in *Astronomy \& Astrophysics*, 2025.


.. note::

   Astrophysics applications rely on a neural network-based approximation of the forward model for

   - faster evaluation
   - ability to evaluate derivatives

   The package used to derive this approximation is `nnbma` (Neural Network-Based Model Approximation).
   Here are the links towards the corresponding
   `GitHub repository <https://github.com/einigl/ism-model-nn-approximation>`_,
   `PyPi package <https://pypi.org/project/nnbma/>`_
   and `documentation <https://ism-model-nn-approximation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_.

============
Installation
============

To prepare and perform an inversion, we recommend installing the package.
The package can be installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install beetroots

or by cloning the repo.
To clone, install and test the package, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:pierrePalud/beetroots.git
   cd beetroots
   poetry install # or poetry install -E notebook -E docs for extra dependencies
   poetry shell
   pytest

Package structure and how to adapt it to your use cases
=======================================================

This package is large and contains a lot of python modules.
To facilitate code exploration and use, here is an un-rigorous UML class diagram of the code:
